class Middleware(object):
    """
    The base class for all Middlewares.

    Middlewares hook into the read/write process of TinyDB allowing you to
    extend the behaviour by adding caching, logging, ...

    Your middleware's ``__init__`` method has to accept exactly one
    argument which is the class of the "real" storage. It has to be stored as
    ``_storage_cls`` (see :class:`~tinydb.middlewares.CachingMiddleware` for an
    example).
    """

    def __init__(self, storage_cls=TinyDB.DEFAULT_STORAGE):
        self._storage_cls = storage_cls
        self.storage = None

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """
        Create the storage instance and store it as self.storage.

        Usually a user creates a new TinyDB instance like this::

            TinyDB(storage=StorageClass)

        The storage kwarg is used by TinyDB this way::

            self._storage = storage(*args, **kwargs)

        As we can see, ``storage(...)`` runs the constructor and returns the
        new storage instance.


        Using Middlewares, the user will call::

                                       The 'real' storage class
                                       v
            TinyDB(storage=Middleware(StorageClass))
                       ^
                       Already an instance!

        So, when running ``self._storage = storage(*args, **kwargs)`` Python
        now will call ``__call__`` and TinyDB will expect the return value to
        be the storage (or Middleware) instance. Returning the instance is
        simple, but we also got the underlying (*real*) StorageClass as an
        __init__ argument that still is not an instance.
        So, we initialize it in __call__ forwarding any arguments we recieve
        from TinyDB (``TinyDB(arg1, kwarg1=value, storage=...)``).

        In case of nested Middlewares, calling the instance as if it was an
        class results in calling ``__call__`` what initializes the next
        nested Middleware that itself will initialize the next Middleware and
        so on.
