0.5.4
Create Variable per device for google map url
(can use with Jay's Indigo Variable addition https://www.indigodomo.com/library/405/)
Can use as link to external url to open google maps on this location
Uses url shortcut for googlemaps application

Changes to Geofence Exit/Entry - uses Accuracy to avoid enter/exits when accuracy is very poor

Further changes to use ratio of Accuracy to GeoFence Range

Will only set entry/exit geofence events and triggers if accuracy versus geofence range is less than 2
e.g.
Geo range of 100m. Accuracy is 1000m. (poor) Ratio = 10 won't entry/exit until more accurate reading
Geo of 100m. Accuracy of 200. Ratio of 2 - will (just allow) entry/exit
Geo of 100m. Accuracy of 5. Ratio 1/20. Will allow with trigger entry/exit

Create small separate FFM-GeoFence log file for data collection of these accuracy ratio/settings - in normal log file directory. Happy to finetune ratio if more data seems to suggest makes sense.

Currently ratio of 2 - seems to be ideal spot.
