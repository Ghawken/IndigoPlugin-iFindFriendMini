#FindFriendsMini

This was initally envisioned as a update to iFindStuff enabling bypassing of non-functional 2FA.  However updating iFindStuff began a rabbit hole I almost didn't escape out of!  

Hence this new, plugin:
Aid of which is to create indigo devices representing iFindFriends from iCloud
Enabling tracking and later mapping of device location
It bypasses 2FA problems (which remain in the base python libraries currently) by not enabling it for the account used.

Usage:

Create icloud Account (WITHOUT 2FA)  ie.  Your Indigo mac computer.
(Some will have this already for imessage etc usage)

In FindFriendsMini Create iCloud Account enter these details, confirm.

Create New FindFriendsMini device - FindFriendDevice
Select iCloud Account using
Select Friend
